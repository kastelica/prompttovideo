## 🔧 Customization Options

### Emoji Sets
Modify the emoji arrays in the JavaScript to add/remove reaction options:

const emojis = ['👍', '❤️', '😂', '😮', '😢', '😡', '🔥', '👏', '🤔', '💯'];
```

### Chat Styling
Customize the chat appearance by modifying the Tailwind CSS classes in the templates:
- Message bubble colors
